    Do you love Apple Wireless Keyboard but also love Microsoft Windows? Ever wanted to use them together?
    Now you can without losing your media functionality.
    This Windows application brings your Fn key and media keys back to life with Mac-like status overlays.
    It lets you choose if you want to access media keys with Fn or instead of Function keys, by just pressing the eject key.

AppleWirelessKeyboard is a small utility program for Windows that talks to the Apple Wireless Keyboard and responds to the Fn and Eject keys.
Then it simulates native mac functionality.
It adds the beautiful semitransparent overlays adds functions to otherwise dead keys.

        Some antivirus programs detect this program as a virus.
        This is because it is intercepts key presses to provide its functionality.
        If you are still afraid, you can check out the source code on GitHub or use one of many decompilers to examine the source code of the program.

        Apple Wired Keyboard is supported, but the fn key will not work.
        Thats because the keyboard doesn't send the event to the computer at all.
        Fn key doesn't work on Apple USB Keyboard. Its a hardware issue i can't fix.

### About

This small utility prevents the computer automatically locking the screen after a period of inactivity. 
Its great for letting downloads complete or when watching a movie. 
Normally the screen locking can be disabled by settings in Windows, but not when they are overridden by company group policy. 
This is where this program comes in.
